\title{Generate All Hypergraphs from Clustering Results}
\usage{
generate_all_hypergraphs(
  clustering_results,
  weight_list,
  algorithms = c("SC3", "CIDR", "Seurat", "SIMLR", "TSNE_Kmeans", "Monocle", "RaceID")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clustering_results}{A named list containing clustering results from
different algorithms. Each element should be a vector of cluster assignments.}

\item{weight_list}{A named list of normalized validation indices used for
weighting the hypergraphs. Each element should be a named list with
algorithm names as keys and weights as values.}

\item{algorithms}{A character vector specifying which algorithms to include
in the hypergraph generation. Default includes common single-cell
clustering algorithms.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{H}{Standard combined hypergraph matrix}
\item{HH}{Standard hypergraph similarity matrix}
\item{H_\link{metric}}{Weighted hypergraph matrices for each validation metric}
\item{HH_\link{metric}}{Weighted hypergraph similarity matrices for each validation metric}
}
}
\description{
This function creates hypergraph matrices from clustering results and applies
various weighting schemes based on validation indices. It generates both
standard and weighted hypergraph representations for ensemble clustering.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Creates binary hypergraph matrices for each clustering algorithm
\item Combines matrices to form standard hypergraph representation
\item Applies validation-based weights to create weighted hypergraphs
\item Computes hypergraph similarity matrices (H * H^T)
\item Normalizes matrices appropriately
}

The hypergraph matrix H has dimensions n_samples x n_hyperedges, where
each hyperedge represents a cluster from a specific algorithm.
